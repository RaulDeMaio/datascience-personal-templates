# Data Science Project Template

This template has been built after reading the [Medium article by khuyetran1401](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-structure-an-ml-project-for-reproducibility-and-maintainability-54d5e53b4c82?sk=c3d05ae5b8ccc95822618d0dacfad8a4).
It would be much simpler to just fork its repo but I prefer to build it by myself to understand each component.
It has been built to be easy and quick to use. 

For 'industrial' or more 'business' projects, I still prefer tools like [Kedro](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/).

## Features and Roadmap

:white_check_mark: Automatically build repository structure for DS personal projects

:white_check_mark: Create and Build an environment using conda

:black_square_button: Run Tests automatically

:black_square_button: Manage configuration variables for data pipelines and projects

:white_check_mark: Enforce hints and quality code

:black_square_button: Automatically Document Code

:black_square_button: Automate Code

:white_check_mark: [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/start) for Data Management and Experiment Management

### To Do
- Automate setup of dvc repo and .gitignore

## Tools used

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/): Package, dependency and environment management
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks. 

## Template Structure

```bash
.

│   ├──environment.yml           # Environment file for conda
├── data                         # Local project data (not committed to version control)
│   ├── 01_raw                   # Raw immutable data

├── docs                         # Project documentation
├── models                       # Project configuration files
├── notebooks                    # Project related Jupyter notebooks (used for experimental code before moving code to src)
├── README.md                    # Project README
└── src                          # Project source code

```

## How to use this template

Install Cookiecutter:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

Create a project based on the template:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/radema/datascience-personal-templates
```

Activate the new environment

```bash
conda activate {{cookiecutter.environment_name}}
```

Execute setup in terminal

```bash
cd {{cookiecutter.repository-name}}; make setup
```
