# Data Science Project Template

This template has been built after reading the [Medium article by khuyetran1401](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-structure-an-ml-project-for-reproducibility-and-maintainability-54d5e53b4c82?sk=c3d05ae5b8ccc95822618d0dacfad8a4).
It would be much simpler to just fork its repo but I prefer to build it by myself to understand each component.
It has been built to be easy and quick to use. For 'industrial' or more 'business' projects, I still prefer tools like Kedro.

## Features and Roadmap

[x] Automatically build repository structure for DS personal projects 
[x] Create and Build an environment using conda
[ ] Run Tests automatically
[ ] Enforce hints and quality code
[ ] Automatically Document Code
[ ] Automate Code

## Tools used

- Conda
